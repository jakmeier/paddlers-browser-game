//! The game event manager handles events that are generated by SPECS systems.
//!
//! Sometimes, a SPEC system triggers some rare effect that it cannot handle
//! with the state that it usually requires. Always reading that other state
//! as well would cause too broad locking and often blows up parameters that
//! are being passed around.
//! As a solution, the system can send a message with the corresponding event
//! to the game event manager who always operates on the entire game state.
//!
//! Try to keep computations in here short and simple.
